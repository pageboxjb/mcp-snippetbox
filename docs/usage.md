# Usage

The README covers the basics. This page collects the
longer examples and the notes that did not fit up front.

## Basic

```bash
# claude_desktop_config.json  (use ABSOLUTE paths: Claude does not
# run from the repo directory, so a bare "server.py" is not found)
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "notes-box": {
#       "command": "python",
#       "args": ["/abs/path/to/mcp-snippetbox/server.py"],
#       "env": {"MCP_NOTES_FILE": "/abs/path/to/notes.json"}
#     }
#   }
# }
python server.py --help
```

## Notes

- Every tool carries a real docstring, so clients get descriptions
- Five tools: add / get / update / delete / list notes
